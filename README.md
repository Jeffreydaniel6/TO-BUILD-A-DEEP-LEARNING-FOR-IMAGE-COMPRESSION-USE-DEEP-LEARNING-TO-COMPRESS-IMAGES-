# TO-BUILD-A-DEEP-LEARNING-FOR-IMAGE-COMPRESSION-USE-DEEP-LEARNING-TO-COMPRESS-IMAGES-
A Conditional GAN (cGAN) model built using PyTorch to generate high-quality images conditioned on input labels or attributes. Trained on datasets like MNIST or CelebA, it enables controlled image synthesis for applications such as data augmentation, image generation, and creative AI tasks.
